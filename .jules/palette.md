## 2025-03-20 - Explicit button types in Error Boundaries
**Learning:** React Error Boundaries (like `ExperimentErrorBoundary`) can unexpectedly submit forms if their fallback UI includes `<button>` elements without explicit types (which default to `type="submit"` in HTML), leading to jarring page reloads or side effects when an error occurs inside a form context.
**Action:** Always add `type="button"` to `<button>` elements in fallback UIs and generic components unless they are explicitly intended to submit a form.

## 2025-05-24 - Accessible Dynamic Navigation
**Learning:** When dynamically generating Table of Contents or similar navigation buttons that rely on scroll interactions rather than standard anchor links, screen reader users miss out on active state context, and keyboard users need explicit focus indicators.
**Action:** Always apply `aria-current="true"` conditionally to indicate the active section to screen readers, and combine with accessible focus rings (`focus-visible:outline-hidden focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-ring`).
